## Reading that is Related to this Week's Lectures and/or This Problem Set

For this problem set, we are going to learn Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) cryptography by implementing _the first six sections_ of the Wikibook [A Basic Public Key Example]( https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A_Basic_Public_Key_Example ). For convenience I snarfed a printable copy of those six sections into this project.

The Achilles heel of RSA cryptography is that you had to give your public key to somebody, and this step was susceptible to a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, partly because the delivery of the public key was done "in the clear" (unencrypted), and partly because the delivery of the public key was a one-time-only operation, so if that step was compromised, all communication thereafter was compromised.

So, if we have time, we could look at the Diffie-Helman-Merkle key exchange protocol, which largely solves the problem of key exchange. Combining public-key/private-cryptography with Diffie-Helman-Merkle key exchange is the foundation of private digital communication. [Diffie and Hellman just won the Turing Award]( http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/01/diffie_and_hellman_scoop_turing_award_for_key_work_on_crypto/ ) for the protocol. (Why was Merkle left out?)

With NSA-level computing resources, keys of length 1024 bits may be breakable. With the same methods, but using even larger keys, private conversations can be kept private. For example, iMessage uses these methods with 1280-bit keys. This is documented in the [iOS Security White Paper]( http://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf ). See page 39. The iOS Security White Paper is pretty easy-going reading given the complexity of the issues.

## Directions Specific to this Problem Set

This is the first of two Problem Sets on RSA cryptography. We need a bunch of utilities involving primes, so that's what you'll build first.
 
Implement the following functions:
 
1. (2 pts) primes(highest: Int) -> [Int]

2. (2 pts) factor(h: Int, candidates: [Int]) -> Int?

3. (2 pts) factors(g: Int, candidates: [Int]) -> [Int]
 
4. (2 pts) factors(g: Int) -> [Int]

5. (2 pts) coprimes(f: Int) -> [Int]
 
If you do them in order and do them correctly, each time you finish a function, some more unit tests will pass.
 
I have created skeleton implementations for each of these functions. They just return nil or an empty array. Those skeleton functions are what you must re-implement.
 
Be sure to read the comments around each function.

The hardest function would have been the first one, but I already implemented a lot of it by implementing sieveOfEratosthenes, which you can just use.
 
## General Directions for all Problem Sets
 
1. Fork this repository to create a repository in your own Github account. Then clone your fork to whatever machine you are working on.
 
2. These problem sets are created with the latest version of Xcode and Mac OS X: Xcode 7.3 and OS X 10.11.4. I haven't tested how well this problem set will work under Xcode 7.2.1, but it probably will.
 
3. Under no circumstances copy-and-paste any part of a solution from another student in the class. Also, under no circumstances ask outsiders on Stack Exchange or other programmers' forums to help you create your solution. It is however fine&mdash;especially when you are truly stuck&mdash;to ask others to help you with your solution, provided you do all of the typing. They should only be looking over your shoulder and commenting. It is of course also fine to peruse StackExchange and whatever other resources you find helfpul.
 
4. Your solution should be clean and exhibit good style. At minimum, Xcode should not flag warnings of any kind. Your style should match Apple's as shown by their examples and declarations. Use the same indentation and spacing around operators as Apple uses. Use their capitalization conventions. Use parts of speech and grammatical number the same way as Apple does. Use descriptive names for variables. Avoid acronyms or abbreviations. I am still coming up to speed on good Swift style. When there appears to be conflict my style and Apple's, copy Apple's, not mine.
 
5. When completed, before the class the problem set is due, commit your changes to your fork of the repository. I should be able to simply clone your fork, build it and execute it in my environment without encountering any warnings, adding any dependencies or making any modifications.
